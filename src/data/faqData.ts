        questions: [
            { q: "What is MTRIX?", a: "MTRIX isn’t a store — it’s an upgrade. We build gear for people who want their setup to look as sharp as their grind. Bold colors, clean lines, premium finish… no boring vibes allowed." },
            { q: "Why should I trust MTRIX?", a: "Simple. We don’t sell random catalogue items. Every product is curated, tested, and built to match our quality benchmark — If it’s not MTRIX-level, it doesn’t get listed." },
            { q: "Are MTRIX products limited edition?", a: "Some drops are permanent, but our boldest designs drop in limited batches. Once they’re gone… portal closes. 👀⚡" }

        questions: [
            { q: "How long will my order take to arrive?", a: "Usually 4–7 days depending on location. Metro cities get it faster. Rural areas might take a bit more." },
            { q: "Can I track my order?", a: "Of course. Once your order ships, you’ll get a tracking link on email and WhatsApp.\nWe don’t ghost — we guide. 😉" },
            { q: "Do you offer Cash on Delivery (COD)?", a: "Yes! COD is available for most products. If a product is prepaid-only, we’ll clearly mention it." },
            { q: "I need to update my address. What do I do?", a: "If the order hasn’t shipped yet, message us immediately. We’ll fix it faster than your FPS drops." }

        category: "3. PRODUCTS & QUALITY",
        questions: [
            { q: "Are the colors exactly like the photos?", a: "98% yes. Slight variations might happen due to screen differences — but the real product hits harder." },
            { q: "Are deskmats and mousepads washable?", a: "Yup. Hand-wash with mild soap. No bleaching, no harsh scrubbing. Treat it like your setup — with respect." },
            { q: "Will my product wear out?", a: "Everything wears out someday, but our materials are built to survive long sessions, long nights, and long grinds." }

        questions: [

            { q: "Do you accept returns if I simply don’t like the product?", a: "Yes — eligible products can be returned within 5 days of delivery. They must be unused and in original packaging." },
            { q: "How long does a refund take?", a: "2–5 working days after we receive and verify the returned product." }
